## Abstract

Build a MTaaS (Mobile Testing as a Service) system by providing a simple solution to users where managers and testers can work on projects together by sharing the required files and test reports. Testing can be done using various resources allocated and deallocated when required and a billing component will show the project managers about the cost associated with the resources that have been used in their projects.
